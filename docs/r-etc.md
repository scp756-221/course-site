## Key points

This week's reading is a collection of "state of the world" articles that brings you up-to-date with the current state of the ("Big Data") world.

Article 3 includes pointer to some projects that your project team may wish to pursue including:

* [Seldon](https://github.com/SeldonIO/seldon-core): converts an ML model into a REST microservice
* [Binder](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub): server Jupyter notebooks from a Kubernetes cluster

Article 4 provides a broader picture around [istio](https://istio.io/). Adding a service mesh to your microservices system makes it easy/possible to perform:
* traffic management (circuit breaking, fault injection, traffic shifting, etc)
* blue/green deployment
* canary deployment

[Guide 3](https://scp756-221.github.io/course-site//#/g3-mesh/page?embedded=true&hidegitlink=true) walks you through a few of these.

## Parts to skim

Article 1 & 2 are decidedly pitching a product; you can safely ignore them (Iguazio in the former and Kyligence in the latter).
