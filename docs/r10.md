1. [Cloud computing storms a bastion of the enterprise: the data warehouse](https://siliconangle.com/2020/11/15/cloud-computing-storms-bastion-enterprise-data-warehouse/)

## Key points

1. The article is from November 2020 which is only 15 months ago. The debate between data warehouse vs data lake has already evolved towards a new data lakehouse ("an extended data lake") that provides data warehousing capability. See [Dremio](https://www.dremio.com/platform/cloud/), [Databrick's Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks), [Tabular](https://tabular.io/), and others).
2. Watch for references to Hadoop. What surprised you?
3. The implicit assumption of the article is a readiness/willingness to move one's data to the cloud. This is not always the case.
4. Note the number of vendors/commercial entities. The notables that went by included: Snowflake, Cloudera, Databricks, Fivetran, Teradata, Google, AWS, Microsoft, Oracle, AtScale, Tableau, Dremio, & Exasol.
