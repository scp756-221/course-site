# Assignment 5&mdash;Applying Agile via GitHub

## Introduction

GitHub's issue is by no means a comprehensive tool for implementing Scrum. However, it is highly functional for smaller scale projects/teams and has the benefit of being integrated within a popular code repository. This assignment gives you a better-than-tourist's view of GitHub. You will dive into features that you typically might not be aware of/otherwise touch: organizations, Kanban boards (projects) and the workflow process.

Before starting this assignment, get in touch with at least 2 other students. This will be your *assignment team*. (Your assignment team is only in effect for  assignment 5. It has no relation to the term project.) **Even though you have this assignment team, Assignment 5 is submitted and graded individually.**

#### Create an organization

An organization allows you to organize material (e.g., source code, issues, Kanban board and more) and control access to them. This can be used to represent a company, a team or a community (e.g., committers on an open source projects).

Explore creating and deleting an organization. Practice granting and revoking access to the organization.

When you are comfortable with this, [create an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.16/admin/user-management/creating-organizations) and name it "CMPT756-A5-Org-lastname-firstname" (substituting your first and last name as appropriate). Add your assignment team members to this organization. Set your classmates' role to **"Member"**. You will need to wait for your team member's acceptance to join the organization before they are added to your team. In the interim, watch for and accept the invitation from GitHub on behalf of your assignment team member to join their assignment team. The subject is similar to `[GitHub] @otherStudentGithubId has invited you to join the @CMPT756-A5-Org...`

Submit the URL of this organization.

#### Create a repository within the organization

A repository holds the artifacts for a specific concern. This may be software but it extends to include source code, configuration, documentation, diagrams, etc.

Work with your assignment team to explore creating/deleting repositories, granting/revoking access to the repositories etc. Observe that access to the repository is inherited from the organization. This is an ideal opportunity to practice using Zoom or any other conferencing tool you want to use.

When you are comfortable with this, [create a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) within the organization and name it "MYC756PROJECT". Confirm that this repo is public. 

#### Create issues inside the repository

In GitHub, a task is created either as a to-do or an issue. A to-do can be converted into an issue for a specific repository.

An issue represents a topic to address within a project. Note that GitHub does not provide any construct beyond issue while Scrum advocates for a hierarchy to represent the complexity of real systems. (Recall some tools highlighted in [this week's readings](https://scp756-221.github.io/course-site/#/r5?embedded=true&hidegitlink=true).)

Practice [creating to-dos and issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), triaging them (assigning them to repo) and assigning them to various members of the assignment team.

Create at least 3 issues (content is not important) and assign one each to yourself and your 2 assignment team members.

Submit the URLs of these issues.


#### 2.4 Create Projects (Kanban boards)

A board is a visual representation of your workflow. GitHub calls a board a 'project'. (I will adopt GitHub's terminology from this point on.) Workflows in Github are defined within each project. A project can be scoped to [an organization](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-project-board#creating-an-organization-wide-project-board) or [a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-a-project-board#creating-a-repository-project-board).

Create 2 boards: one scoped to the repository and a second to the organization.

#### 2.5 Setup the processes inside your boards

A process is the workflow that your organization/team uses to work together.

For your repository-level project, create 2 stages: In-Process and Done.

For your organizational project, create 3 stages: To-Do, In-Process and Done.

Practice flowing your 3 issues across these 2 projects. Observe an issue can be in different stages in different projects.

When you are satisfied, leave one issue in each stage of each board.

Submit the URL of these two projects.


## Submission

Create a PDF file and include the following:

1. URL of your organization.

2. URLs of your issues.

3. URLs of your two projects.


Submit the file to [Assignment 5](https://coursys.sfu.ca/2022sp-cmpt-756-g1/+a5/) in CourSys.
